          and engaging. Itâ€™s about solving real-world problems and making the
          internet a better place, one line of code at a time. Plus, the thrill
          of seeing your creation come to life instantly is hard to beat.

          <h1>My Current Target</h1>
          <p>
            Starting out as a web developer is an exciting journey! Your current
            targets might include mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building
            a portfolio with small projects, and understanding basic version
            control with Git. Maybe even experimenting with frameworks like
            React or Vue. Each step is a new skill in your toolkit. Where do you
            feel you need the most guidance right now?

            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>
              HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundation of web
              pages. It structures content with elements like headings,
              paragraphs, links, images, and more.

            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>
              CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is all about the visuals of your
              web page. It allows you to apply styles like colors, fonts, and
              layout to your HTML structure.

            <img src="/images/js.png" alt="Card image" />
            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <p>
              JavaScript is the dynamic heartbeat of web development, bringing
              interactivity to your websites. Unlike HTML (the structure) and
              CSS (the style), JavaScript makes things happen.
